// Nodejs Repl
// If we omit the filename, we use it in REPL mode:
// node
// You can inspect the globals you have access to by typing global. and pressing tab.

// The _special variable
// If after some code you type _, that is going to print the result of the last operation.

// .help: shows the dot commands help
// .editor: enables editor mode, to write multiline JavaScript code with ease. Once you are in this mode, enter ctrl-D to run the code you wrote.
// .break: when inputting a multi-line expression, entering the .break command will abort further input. Same as pressing ctrl-C.
// .clear: resets the REPL context to an empty object and clears any multi-line expression currently being input.
// .load: loads a JavaScript file, relative to the current working directory
// .save: saves all you entered in the REPL session to a file (specify the filename)
// .exit: exits the repl (same as pressing ctrl-C two times)
